      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Ginataang Pusit or Squid cooked in coconut milk is a quick, easy, and delicious Filipino dish that I love to eat with warm rice. As I've d mentioned, this is quick and easy because it takes less than 30 minutes to prepare and the steps are simple and straightforward. Many people like this dish spicy (that includes myself); this is the reason why I have 4 pieces of Serrano peppers in the recipe. You can use Jalapeno pepper to make it spicier or you can also opt to not use any pepper or chili if you cannot handle the heat.</p>
  
      <p>Small to medium sized squids are perfect for this recipe. Make sure that you wash the squid thoroughly and remove the ink sac so that the dish won't turn black. If you insist to use large squid, try to slice it into pieces and cook it a bit longer</p>
  
      <p>Aside from fish sauce (patis), you can also use bagoong alamang for this recipe. I also like to use malunggay whether fresh or fresh frozen, but I understand that malunggay might not be available to everyone. If that is the case, you can use fresh spinach a substitute for malunggay.</p>
